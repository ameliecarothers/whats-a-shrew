              Shrews are among nature's most remarkable creatures - | tiny insectivorous mammals 
              that look like miniature mice but are actually more closely related to moles and 
              hedgehogs. Despite their small size (some species weigh less than a penny!), 
              shrews are fierce predators with extraordinary metabolisms.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              These incredible animals must eat every 2-3 hours to survive, consuming up to 
              three times their body weight daily. With hearts beating up to 1,200 times per 
              minute, shrews live life at an incredible pace that most other mammals couldn't sustain.

        <h2>Why Shrews Matter</h2>
        <div className="conservation-content">
          <p>
            Shrews play a vital role in our ecosystems as natural pest controllers, consuming 
            vast quantities of insects, slugs, and other invertebrates. Their presence indicates 
            a healthy environment, and they serve as an important food source for owls, hawks, 
            and other predators.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Despite their importance, many people have never heard of shrews or mistake them for 
            mice. By learning about these remarkable creatures, we can better appreciate the 
            incredible diversity of life around us and understand why even the smallest animals 
            deserve our protection and respect.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            <strong>You can help shrews by:</strong> Creating wildlife-friendly gardens, avoiding 
            pesticides, leaving leaf litter and fallen logs for shelter, and spreading awareness 
            about these amazing tiny predators!
          </p>
